This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiUlml9MDk) by Traversy Media on creating a QR Code Generator inspired me to create my own version. _Note:_ I did not follow the tutorial.

QR Codes are useful for mobile phone users to access links simply and quickly.

## How to use:

1.  Fill up the _URL_ field with the link to your website.
2.  (Optional) Select the _size_ of the QR Code you want. Measurement is in pixels.
3.  (Optional) Select the _colours_ you want for the QR Code. _Foreground Color_ is the color of the code and _Background Color_ is the color surrounding the QR Code.
4.  Click on _submit_ and wait for your QR Code to generate.
5.  (Laptop/Desktop) _Right click_ on the QR code and click on _Save as image..._
6.  (Android/iOS) Follow your platform's specific instructions on how to download images from a website.

This project is build in HTML, CSS and plain JavaScript. I used **CSS Grid** to for the body and form layout and **Flexbox** for the header. The [QRCode.js](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs) library is used to render the QR Code.
